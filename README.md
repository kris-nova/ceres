This is a guideline about how to turn ordinary humans into tech superheroes.

[Text within brackets is meta—to be discussed.]

## Introduction

### Why?

You wake up tomorrow and the world has just turned into real-life Star Trek. Money is no object, free energy is a thing, superluminal travel is trivial.

Every human alive gets their own ~~salt&vinegar crisps~~ food replicator. Travel routes between every star, planet, and celestial body need to be established. We must load-balance the grid to account for our newfound unlimited supply of energy. New worlds at our fingertips mean colonies need to be voted for, planned, supplied, built, and populated.

There are at least a hundred startup ideas in the paragraph above alone.

And you’re gonna write that code.

### Because.

You’ll see the galaxy, party in private jets, get all the salt&vinegar crisps you could possibly want. Oh, and a sexy new uniform too (send pics pls).

## First steps

### Github & document *everything*

When should one start to use version control? So, that moment when you first change your code and it stops working… the day before.

It’s also the basis for collaborative coding, which unless you’re a lone genius is what you’ll be doing. You should also do it if you’re a genius too though.

And the reason to document your way down this path is two-fold: One, to share it. You might stumble across awesome stuff that the rest of the world might as well learn too. And second, for your own self-study. When you get to the end of a week and it feels you got nothing done the past few days? Go back and read what you’ve done in detail. Compare where you were with where you are. Often the emotional feeling of accomplishment has nothing to do with actual reality.

Okay, fine, but… How?

* How to: [Git-it is a desktop (Mac, Windows and Linux) app that teaches you how to use Git and GitHub on the command line.](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)
* [TODO: Write a short guide that’s a “here’s what to do, when, and why” instead of just a list of commands. To imprint familiarity instead of a bunch of functionality that makes no sense without proper context. E.g. how does one actually roll back code?]
* [TODO: A document about how to document things appropriately. Idea: Entries with titles that will be meaningful by themselves on a list later, when you wanna share your story with other people. “Day 1: Wrote a 5000w article about how much I hate Bootstrap” “Day 1½: Read chapter 5 of some book” etc. Then use the entry bodies for “Dear diary, today…” which no one will ever read apart from the writer and their mom.]

### Track time & be accountable

Tracking time is a great way to make sure you're spending the time dedicated to a task actually doing it.

It's also a good way to be held accountable e.g. if you make your entries visible to someone else, or public altogether.

Suggestion: org-mode.

And a caveat: Talking about doing something *is not* doing it. Talking with your friends about everything you *want* to do doesn't count as productive work, unless the talking is actively discussing a tool or workflow.

[Issue: Intermittent work done five minutes at a time during the day job. Is it trackable somehow?]

Here's a silly idea for a project around this: make it so that whenever you clock in or out, the entry gets pushed into a server that can then display it in real time for your mother, dog, and friends to see.

* [TODO: Once the project above is done, document it.]
* [TODO: Simple org-mode tutorial focused on time tracking exclusively.]
* [TODO: Ideas article about time management.]

### Create an environment

[Not sure this is actually a thing or just a hunch of mine: I have the idea that creating a special environment dedicated to a task helps in some way. 

So that could be: create a new username on the computer for the new 1337 work and keep it clean and distraction free. If you have too much money burning a hole in your pocket: get a new laptop for it. If you’re a fan of burning bridges: say goodbye to your FPS games collection and install your first linux distro. That kinda thing. 

In my case: [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)—*all* the ricing.]

* [IDEA: Share interesting setups and *how to get them working*. A newbie won’t figure out how to implement a bunch of customizations themselvels just out of a pile of dotfiles.]

### Choose a text editor

There are many options here: vim or emacs. The correct choice, of course, being the latter.

Either way it’s hard, and it will take some effort. This knowledge will serve you for life though, so get to it.

### Join an open source project and do *anything*

This follows on the *Github & document* header. It doesn’t matter *what* you intend to do in the future—be it design, code, spoonbending,—you need to be able to do it collaboratively.

So learn how it works and start getting used to it while your learn your kung-fu.
